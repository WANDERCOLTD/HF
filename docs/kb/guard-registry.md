# Guard Registry

> Consolidates **every executable guard, ratchet, and contract** in HF into one
> CHAIN-style table, classified by whether it survives the hardening. Generalises
> the pattern proven in [`docs/CHAIN-CONTRACTS.md`](../CHAIN-CONTRACTS.md).
>
> **Guards stay as code.** This registry catalogues them and points at the source —
> it never re-implements them as prose. A guard encodes *"the system must still
> prevent #X in any architecture"* — exactly what a rewrite would silently lose.

## Survives-hardening classification (the load-bearing column)

| Class | Meaning | Hardening treatment |
|---|---|---|
| **(a) Invariant** | True in *any* architecture (AI-safety, data integrity, no cross-tenant leak) | **Carry forward** — re-express in the new structure. Highest value. |
| **(b) Scaffold** | Protects *today's* implementation detail (e.g. current slug-uniqueness, the #1177 collapse) | **Consciously retire** when the detail changes — never lose by accident. |
| **(c) Drain** | Temporary ratchet for an in-flight migration | Track to zero, then delete. |
| **(meta)** | Process gate / fitness function (not domain logic) | Keep & extend — these are the methodology. |

## KB-link convention (makes this registry load-bearing)

Every guard points **back** at its row here, closing the loop *guard fires → reads the
invariant → understands the incident → doesn't bypass it*:

- **ESLint rules** set `meta.docs.url` → `…/guard-registry.md#guard-<rule-name>`.
- **`check-*` scripts** print the same anchor URL in their failure output.
- Each wired guard gets a stable anchor below (`<a id="guard-…">`). The table is the
  index; the anchored **Guard detail** blocks are the link targets.

**Meta-ratchet:** [`scripts/capture/check-guard-kb-links.ts`](../../apps/admin/scripts/capture/check-guard-kb-links.ts)
counts ESLint rules missing a KB link and fails if the count rises above its baseline —
a guard that guards the guards. Baseline only ever drops as rules are wired (currently 1/10 wired).

## ESLint rules — `apps/admin/eslint-rules/`

✅ = KB-linked (`meta.docs.url` set).

All 12 rules **✅ KB-linked** (`meta.docs.url` → the matching `#guard-<name>` anchor below).
The meta-ratchet (`check-guard-kb-links.ts`) holds this at 12/12.

### Guard detail

<a id="guard-no-ai-fanout-all"></a>
**`no-ai-fanout-all`** · class **(a) invariant** · born #854/#878 ·
[rule source](../../apps/admin/eslint-rules/no-ai-fanout-all.mjs) ·
invariant → [`invariants.md`](./invariants.md#ai-to-db-never-let-ai-output-directly-drive-entity-creation)

The pending-changes tray (epic #854) has an asymmetric-default safety property: an
AI-initiated config change may request a **single-caller** recompose, never a **cohort
fan-out**. "Recompose all N affected learners" (Toggle 2) must remain a human-only switch.
This rule fires when an AI tool executor passes `fanoutScope: 'all'` to
`updatePlaybookConfig` / `updateDomainConfig` / `updateAnalysisSpecConfig`. Use `'caller'`
or `'none'`. **Survives hardening:** a domain-safety truth independent of architecture —
carry it forward (post-multi-tenancy it also bounds blast radius to a single tenant's learner).

<a id="guard-no-ai-forbidden-fields"></a>
**`no-ai-forbidden-fields`** · class **(a) invariant** ·
[rule source](../../apps/admin/eslint-rules/no-ai-forbidden-fields.mjs)

AI tool `input_schema.properties` may not declare globally forbidden fields — `role`,
`domainId`, `ownerId`, per-parent identity slugs. Privilege escalation, cross-tenant moves,
and identity reassignment are **human-only**. **Survives hardening:** this is the AI-side
twin of the tenant-isolation invariant — directly carries into multi-tenancy.

<a id="guard-no-direct-playbook-config-write"></a>
**`no-direct-playbook-config-write`** · class **(a) invariant** · born #826 ·
[rule source](../../apps/admin/eslint-rules/no-direct-playbook-config-write.mjs)

All writes to `Playbook.config` must go through `updatePlaybookConfig`
(`lib/playbook/update-playbook-config.ts`) — the choke point that bumps compose staleness
and routes through the pending-changes tray. Direct `prisma.playbook.update({config})`
bypasses both. **Survives hardening:** the choke-point pattern is architecture-independent.

<a id="guard-no-direct-spec-config-write"></a>
**`no-direct-spec-config-write`** · class **(a) invariant** · born #829 ·
[rule source](../../apps/admin/eslint-rules/no-direct-spec-config-write.mjs)

Compose-affecting `AnalysisSpec` fields may only be written via
`lib/analysis-spec/update-analysis-spec-config.ts`. Same choke-point rationale as the
Playbook rule above.

<a id="guard-no-direct-domain-onboarding-write"></a>
**`no-direct-domain-onboarding-write`** · class **(a) invariant** · born #828 ·
[rule source](../../apps/admin/eslint-rules/no-direct-domain-onboarding-write.mjs)

Domain `onboarding*` / `identitySpec` fields may only be written via
`lib/domain/update-domain-config.ts`. Same choke-point rationale.

<a id="guard-no-orphan-instruction-fallback"></a>
**`no-orphan-instruction-fallback`** · class **(a) invariant** · born #1006/#1008 ·
[rule source](../../apps/admin/eslint-rules/no-orphan-instruction-fallback.mjs) ·
mechanism → [CHAIN-CONTRACTS](../CHAIN-CONTRACTS.md) I-C4

Prompt-composition transforms must not paper over a missing module/LO name with a
generic-noun fallback ("the module", "this objective") — drop the line via a conditional
spread instead. A wrong-but-plausible name silently corrupts the composed prompt.
**Survives hardening:** a content-integrity truth at a COMPOSE-stage boundary.

<a id="guard-no-undeclared-field-require"></a>
**`no-undeclared-field-require`** · class **(a) invariant** · born #1078 ·
[rule source](../../apps/admin/eslint-rules/no-undeclared-field-require.mjs)

`has(...)` may only reference field keys declared in the enclosing spec `define` block —
catches typo'd / removed keys at lint time instead of as a silent always-false at runtime.
**Survives hardening:** contract-integrity between a spec's declaration and its readers.

<a id="guard-no-unscoped-slug-lookup"></a>
**`no-unscoped-slug-lookup`** · class **(b) scaffold** · born #407/#411 ·
[rule source](../../apps/admin/eslint-rules/no-unscoped-slug-lookup.mjs)

Slug/ref lookups on `CurriculumModule` / `LearningObjective` must be scoped by their
parent (`curriculumId`) — slugs are **per-parent-unique, not global**. Use
`resolveModuleByLogicalId`. **Survives hardening: conditionally** — class **b** because it
encodes today's per-parent-unique slug schema. If the data model changes (e.g. globally
unique IDs, or tenant-scoped slugs), retire this rule consciously, in the same PR.

<a id="guard-no-deprecated-curricula-relation"></a>
**`no-deprecated-curricula-relation`** · class **(b) scaffold** · born #1205 ·
[rule source](../../apps/admin/eslint-rules/no-deprecated-curricula-relation.mjs)

Reads of the `@deprecated Playbook.curricula` direct relation are blocked; use the
canonical `Playbook.playbookCurricula` join. **Survives hardening: no** — this is migration
scaffolding for the #1177 Curriculum/Playbook collapse. Delete once the deprecated relation
is dropped from the schema.

<a id="guard-no-module-read-without-course-style-guard"></a>
**`no-module-read-without-course-style-guard`** · class **(b) scaffold** · born #1252 ·
[rule source](../../apps/admin/eslint-rules/no-module-read-without-course-style-guard.mjs)

`CallerModuleProgress` reads/writes must sit behind a `courseStyle === 'structured'` guard
(default-deny). **Survives hardening: conditionally** — tied to the current `courseStyle`
modelling; revisit if course styles are reworked.

<a id="guard-no-bare-call-create"></a>
**`no-bare-call-create`** · class **(a) invariant** · born #1333/#1342 ·
[rule source](../../apps/admin/eslint-rules/no-bare-call-create.mjs)

Every `Call` row entering the pipeline MUST carry `(playbookId, requestedModuleId,
curriculumModuleId)` at creation time; every `Session` row MUST go through `createSession`
so `CallerSequenceCounter` increments atomically, `voiceConfigSnapshot` populates, and the
I-CT2 `usedPromptId` cascade resolves. This rule blocks bare `prisma.call.create` and
`prisma.session.create` outside the explicit allow-list of canonical builder sites.
The allow-list in `no-bare-call-create.mjs` must be updated when adding a deliberate
bypass (harness, seed, batch import) — making the bypass intentional and documented.
**Survives hardening:** FK-completeness and atomic counter assignment are write-path
invariants independent of architecture; the builder pattern carries forward.

<a id="guard-no-hardcoded-greeting-in-composition"></a>
**`no-hardcoded-greeting-in-composition`** · class **(a) invariant** · born #1384 ·
[rule source](../../apps/admin/eslint-rules/no-hardcoded-greeting-in-composition.mjs)

Greeting style ("Hi ${name}!", "Welcome back!") is a course-tunable behaviour — it MUST
be read from `playbook.config.welcome.*` / `firstCall.*` or live in the explicit system-default
templates under `lib/prompt/composition/defaults/`. Literal greeting strings in
prompt-composition transforms or voice assistant-config builders bypass the configurable
layers and make greetings un-customisable from Course Design Console. This rule fires on
`Literal` / `TemplateLiteral` nodes matching the greeting-word regex inside guarded paths
(`lib/prompt/composition/transforms/`, `lib/voice/build-assistant-config.ts`,
`lib/voice/route-handlers.ts`), excepting the explicit defaults allowlist.
**Survives hardening:** "Configuration over Code" for learner-facing utterances is an
architectural principle, not tied to the current prompt-composition structure.

<a id="guard-no-vapi-column-ref"></a>
**`hf-voice/no-vapi-column-ref`** · class **(a) invariant** · born #1020/#1024 ·
[rule source](../../apps/admin/eslint-rules/hf-voice/no-vapi-column-ref.mjs) ·
mechanism → [CHAIN-CONTRACTS](../CHAIN-CONTRACTS.md) I-VP3 (COMPOSE → VOICE PROVIDER)

#1020 renamed 6 `Call.vapi*` columns to canonical `Call.voice*` to decouple the
schema from any single voice vendor. The audit counter `vapiNamedColumnsOnCallModel`
(#1016) drove to 0 after the migration; this rule keeps it at 0 by failing CI on any
reference to the old names (`vapiCallId`, `vapiTranscript`, `vapiRecordingUrl`,
`vapiCost`, `vapiStartedAt`, `vapiEndedAt`). **Survives hardening:** vendor-neutral
schema naming is an architectural principle independent of which voice providers HF
supports — carry forward through any future provider mix.

<a id="guard-no-vapi-tool-definitions-const"></a>
**`hf-voice/no-vapi-tool-definitions-const`** · class **(a) invariant** · born #1019/#1024 ·
[rule source](../../apps/admin/eslint-rules/hf-voice/no-vapi-tool-definitions-const.mjs) ·
mechanism → [CHAIN-CONTRACTS](../CHAIN-CONTRACTS.md) I-VP2 (COMPOSE → VOICE PROVIDER)

#1019 moved voice tool definitions into the `TOOLS-001` AnalysisSpec; runtime loading
goes through `lib/voice/load-tool-definitions.ts`. The audit counter
`vapiToolDefinitionsConstantPresent` (#1016) drove to 0 after the spec migration; this
rule keeps it at 0 by failing CI on any future re-introduction of a hardcoded TS
constant named `VAPI_TOOL_DEFINITIONS`. **Survives hardening:** the
"specs-as-source-of-truth-for-AI-tooling" pattern is architecture-independent —
parallel rules will be needed if/when other tool-loading constants are migrated.

<a id="guard-no-bespoke-async-polling"></a>
**`no-bespoke-async-polling`** · class **meta** · born G7 / 2026-06-11 ·
[rule source](../../apps/admin/eslint-rules/no-bespoke-async-polling.mjs) ·
helper → [`lib/async/wait-until-ready.ts`](../../apps/admin/lib/async/wait-until-ready.ts) ·
ADR → [chase-prevention methodology](../decisions/2026-06-11-chase-prevention-methodology.md)

Bespoke `setInterval` / `setTimeout` retry loops are the AP-3 chase pattern: every author
re-derives deadline math, abort signalling, structured timeout logging, and the
exception-vs-timeout split — usually subtly wrong. The 2026-06-09 hardening drill shipped
FIVE "wait for X" fixes before the structural cleanup eliminated them. This rule fires on
`while`/`for`/`do-while` blocks containing `setTimeout`/`setInterval`, **outside an
allow-list** of grandfathered call sites (12 today — track to zero in
`lib/rate-limit.ts`, `lib/pipeline/prosody-runner.ts`, `lib/content-trust/extract-*`, etc.).
Severity is `warn` until the migration follow-up; new sites are caught now. The canonical
replacement is `waitUntilReady({ predicate, ready, timeout, interval, label, onTimeout?,
signal? })` from `lib/async/wait-until-ready.ts`. **Survives hardening:** "single async
chokepoint" is a methodology fitness function, architecture-independent.

<a id="guard-no-secrets-in-client"></a>
**`hf-security/no-secrets-in-client`** · class **a** · born HF-J / 2026-06-11 ·

test → [`tests/eslint-rules/no-secrets-in-client.test.ts`](../../apps/admin/tests/eslint-rules/no-secrets-in-client.test.ts)

Anything a `"use client"` component holds as a string literal ships to the browser. The
2026-06-11 audit (HF-B) found `app/login/page.tsx` declaring a module-scope `DEMO_ACCOUNTS`
array with plaintext passwords — present in the PROD bundle regardless of the runtime
`isNonProd` render gate. This rule fires, **only in files carrying the `"use client"`
directive**, when (1) a credential-shaped key (`password`, `secret`, `apiKey`, `privateKey`,
`clientSecret`, `accessToken`, …) is assigned a non-empty string literal, or (2) any literal
matches a high-confidence secret shape (OpenAI `sk-`, Anthropic, AWS `AKIA`, GitHub `ghp_`,
JWT, Google `AIza`). Server files, `process.env.*` / identifier values, and empty strings
pass. The one known offence (the build-stripped demo creds) carries a documented
`eslint-disable` with rationale. Severity `error` from day 1. **Survives hardening:** "no
secret in browser-shipped code" is an architecture-independent data-safety invariant.

<a id="guard-no-hardcoded-spec-slug"></a>
**`hf-config/no-hardcoded-spec-slug`** · class **b** · born HF-I / 2026-06-11 · **status: dormant (off)** ·
[rule source](../../apps/admin/eslint-rules/no-hardcoded-spec-slug.mjs) ·
test → [`tests/eslint-rules/no-hardcoded-spec-slug.test.ts`](../../apps/admin/tests/eslint-rules/no-hardcoded-spec-slug.test.ts)

Spec slugs are env-overridable config (`config.specs.*`, `lib/config.ts`). A literal slug in
runtime code silently stops matching once the corresponding `*_SPEC_SLUG` env var is
overridden. The audit (HF-I) found two live bugs — `extract-goals.ts` wrote
`sourceSpecSlug: "GOAL-001"` to the DB with no config backing (fixed by adding
`config.specs.goal`), and `pedagogy.ts` matched `slug.includes("TUT-001")` (fixed to
`config.specs.defaultArchetype`). The rule fires on a string literal matching
`^[A-Z]{2,}(-[A-Z]+)*-\d{3}$` inside `lib/`+`app/`, allow-listing `lib/config.ts`, tests,
scripts, `prisma/`, and `docs-archive/`. **Dormant at landing:** the rule surfaces 29
residual low-severity literals (10 in `lib/demo/registry.ts`, 3 in the `sector-config`
client mirror, the rest scattered) — activating at `warn` would breach the `lint_warnings`
ratchet, so the rule ships built + tested + registered but `off`. **Activation gate:** sweep
or allow-list the 29, then flip to `warn` → `error`. **Survives hardening as scaffold (b):**
it protects today's `config.specs.*` indirection; retire if the slug-config mechanism changes.

## CI check scripts — `apps/admin/scripts/`

[script source](../../apps/admin/scripts/capture/check-knip-ratchet.ts) · baseline `knip_unused` in `.ratchet.json` · wired into `npm run kb:check`

`knip` (dead-code detector) was configured and ran in CI, but only as `continue-on-error:
true` — so dead code accumulated unchecked (audit HF-H found 161 unused exports+types). This
turns it into a monotonic ratchet: the count of unused EXPORTS + TYPES (the source-only
dead-code signal; dependency/unlisted findings excluded as env-noisy) may only DROP. Baseline
161 at landing. Because `kb:check` is a blocking CI step, this is now a real gate — delete dead
code to lower it, lock the win. **Survives hardening:** "dead code only shrinks" is a
methodology fitness function (legibility ← the whole point of the KB program).

[script source](../../apps/admin/scripts/capture/check-tsc-protected-files.ts) · wired into `npm run kb:check`

The global `tsc_errors` ratchet (`.ratchet.json`, 190) only stops the count *rising* — it
carries a large baseline, and a real bug hid inside it: `ContractRegistry.get(...)` (a
nonexistent method → TS2339) was swallowed by a try/catch so tuned `SKILL_MEASURE_V1` config
silently never loaded (audit HF-A). This guard adds a tighter ring: a hand-picked set of
guard-bearing files (`lib/contracts/registry.ts`, `lib/goals/track-progress.ts`,
`lib/pipeline/aggregate-runner.ts`, `lib/curriculum/resolve-module.ts`,
`lib/voice/{create,end}-session.ts`, `lib/learner-scope.ts`, the two webhook verifiers) MUST
have ZERO tsc errors regardless of the global baseline. A new type error in any of them fails
CI immediately. As the 190 burns down, migrate more files in — the list only grows.
**Survives hardening:** "guard code must type-check" is a methodology fitness function.

The audit's central finding: `tests/lib/route-auth-coverage.test.ts` — a security gate — was
quarantined in `vitest.config.ts` alongside ~30 ordinary flaky tests, and the
`quarantined_tests` ratchet counted it identically, so nothing signalled that an auth gate had
gone dark. This sentinel holds a named registry of GUARD tests (auth-coverage, page-auth,
factual-grounding, learner-scope, validate-manifest, create/end-session, resolve-module,
disclosure-store, retell-auth, skill-tier-mapping) and fails CI if any of them is (a) absent
from disk or (b) present in the vitest exclude block. Retiring a guard test becomes an explicit,
reviewable edit here — never a silent line in the exclude list. **Survives hardening:** "the
guards that guard the system must themselves always run" is a methodology fitness function.

<a id="guard-check-webhook-signature"></a>

[script source](../../apps/admin/scripts/capture/check-webhook-signature.ts) · wired into `npm run kb:check`

The Retell provider shipped a `verifyInboundRequest` that returned `null` unconditionally
(#1079 follow-up debt) — every inbound Retell webhook was trusted WITHOUT signature
verification, a spoofable end-of-call / transcript injection surface. HF-C implemented the
real `x-retell-signature` HMAC check (`lib/voice/providers/retell/auth.ts`); this guard
makes the regression structurally impossible. It brace-matches each
`lib/voice/providers/*/index.ts` `verifyInboundRequest` body, strips comments + `void x;`
no-ops, and fails if what remains is an empty body or a bare `return null`. A compliant impl
delegates to a `verify*` helper or computes an HMAC inline; the "pass-through when no secret
is configured" early return lives INSIDE that helper (dev ergonomics), not in the provider
method. **Survives hardening:** "no unverified webhook ingress" is an architecture-independent
data-safety invariant.

## Process guards — `.githooks/` + `scripts/check-*` (chase-prevention)

| Hook / Script | Catches anti-pattern | Bypass |
|---|---|---|
| [`scripts/check-fix-chain.sh`](../../scripts/check-fix-chain.sh) (post-commit + ratchet) | **AP-2 fix-chain** — ≥3 `fix:` commits on same `#issue`. Ratchet metric: `same_issue_fix_chain_max`. | (warn-only; ratchet enforces) |
| [`scripts/check-reciprocal-edit.sh`](../../scripts/check-reciprocal-edit.sh) (pre-push) | **AP-1 reciprocal-edit** — commit N+1 undoes ≥50% of commit N. | `ALLOW_RECIPROCAL_EDIT=1 git push` (document intent in body) |
| [`scripts/gh-pr-create.sh`](../../scripts/gh-pr-create.sh) (wrapper around `gh pr create`) | **AP-4 verify-before-fix** — PR body without `## Verified by` section + DB query / test name / log / Playwright trace evidence. | `--no-verify-section` flag (warn-only) |
| [`scripts/check-fix-refactor-inversion.ts`](../../scripts/check-fix-refactor-inversion.ts) (PR comment, warn-only) | **AP-5 fix-before-refactor** — `fix:` commit on a file later cleanly refactored on the same branch. | none — report only |

ADR → [chase-prevention methodology](../decisions/2026-06-11-chase-prevention-methodology.md)

Scans the last 30 days of commits on the current branch; for each `fix:` /
`fix(scope):` commit, extracts the `#NNNN` token(s) from subject + body and
groups by issue. Issues with ≥3 commits print a warning urging the
`root-cause` agent before the next fix on the topic. Max-chain-length is also
emitted as a ratchet metric (`same_issue_fix_chain_max`) so the count only
ever ratchets down. **Survives hardening:** AP-2 is a methodology fitness
function — architecture-independent.

ADR → [chase-prevention methodology](../decisions/2026-06-11-chase-prevention-methodology.md)

For commit N+1 vs commit N: compares added vs removed lines (and vice versa);
if ≥50% identical, flags reciprocal edit and exits 1. Wired as `pre-push`.
Bypass requires `ALLOW_RECIPROCAL_EDIT=1` *and* a documented intent in the
commit body (signed off as a deliberate revert). Verified live against the
#1365 → #1366 transcript-parser revert (`vapi-provider.parse-transcript.test.ts`
re-introduces 25/34 removed lines, 73%). **Survives hardening:** AP-1 is a
methodology fitness function — architecture-independent.

Wraps `gh pr create`; requires a `## Verified by` section in the PR body
containing at least one concrete evidence form (SQL query result, vitest
name, Playwright trace path, or log subject line). Enforces the #1406 lesson
(don't trust screenshot OCR — cite an underlying check). **Survives
hardening:** AP-4 is a methodology fitness function — architecture-independent.

**`check-fix-refactor-inversion.ts`** · class **meta** · born 2026-06-11 ·
[script source](../../scripts/check-fix-refactor-inversion.ts)

Warn-only. Scans the current branch's commit history; for each `fix:` commit,
checks whether a later `feat:`/`refactor:` commit on the same branch
substantially overlaps the same files. If yes, the `fix:` was a band-aid the
structural cleanup would have eliminated. Reports as a PR comment, never
blocks. **Survives hardening:** AP-5 fitness function — architecture-independent.

## Drain guards (class c — terminal state, delete when zero)

| Script | Drains | Born |
|---|---|---|
| `migrate-caller-attribute-lo-mastery-keys.ts` | legacy name-form `lo_mastery:*` keys → canonical slug-form | #614 |
| `reconcile-lo-linkage.ts` | LO/assertion soft-FK lag | #615 |
| _other `migrate-*` scripts_ | one-off backfills | _audit per-run_ |

## Doc-only contracts to PROMOTE (the hardening worklist)

`CHAIN-CONTRACTS.md` states the rule: *"if a contract has no enforcement code path, no
test, or no memory doc reference, that's a gap to fix."* Hardening is when we close them —
promote each verbal/doc-only contract into an executable guard (a class-**a** invariant):

- [ ] Every adaptive-loop stage boundary in `CHAIN-CONTRACTS.md` lacking an **Enforcement** cell.
- [ ] `CONTRACTS-PLAYBOOK-CURRICULUM.md` invariants not yet covered by an ESLint rule or CI check.
- [ ] Tenant-isolation invariant (Phase 2): *no tenant-scoped query without a tenant predicate* — promote to a Postgres RLS policy + a fitness-function test.
